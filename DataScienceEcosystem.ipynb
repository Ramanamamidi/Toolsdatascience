    "## Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:\n",
    "1. **Python**: Python is one of the most widely used languages in data science. Its rich ecosystem of libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn makes it an excellent choice for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning.\n",
    "2. **R**: R is another popular language among data scientists, particularly for statistical analysis and data visualization. It offers a wide range of packages for various data science tasks, and its syntax is well-suited for data manipulation and exploration.\n",
    "3. **SQL**: While not a general-purpose programming language like Python or R, SQL (Structured Query Language) is essential for working with databases. Data scientists often use SQL to extract, manipulate, and analyze data stored in relational databases.\n"
